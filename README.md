# cc0-resnet-learning
Download CC0 datasets from museums and train a ResNet-50 on them! WIP, will serve as a backbone for my other ReIndentifiCATion project.

Currently work-in-progress, is suppossed to be updated more or less daily with new commits until it's done.

### Training

1. Use notebooks to download datasets from three museums. They can be done in parallel, this process may take about 30h, depending on set dataset size.
   1. CMA Collection Download
   2. MET Collection Download
   3. NGA Collection Download
2. Use Common Data Format Conversion to create a combined metadata file
3. Use Data Preparation file to create dataset for the network to train on.
   You can look at Data Exploration for the work that was being done on creating the Data Preparation file.


Readme should be updated weekly with progress on the work.
